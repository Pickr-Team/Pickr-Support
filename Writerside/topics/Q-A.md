# Q&amp;A

Is it possible for me to select the students?
: After discussions with the school administrators, it has been decided that supervisors can not select specific students to
participate in their topic. However, you can encourage students to create a custom topic
and choose you as their mentor. **Please be aware that the module leader may make changes to the supervisor of custom topics.**
