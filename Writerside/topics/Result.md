# Result Announcement

## Supervisor's Topic Selector

For those students who selected **the topics provided by the supervisors**: After submission, the system will assign you a supervisor and
topic.
Once the module leader notifies you, you can log in to your account to check.

If you are successfully allocated a supervisor and
topic, you can see the supervisor's information on your personal homepage.

If the system indicates that you **couldn't get a supervisor and topic** in
this round of selection, please wait for the module leader's notification to make your next choice.

## Custom Topic Selector

For those students who created their **custom topic**: Your custom topics will be reviewed by the module leader and modified if
necessary. When the module leader notifies you, please log in to the system to view the final results.
