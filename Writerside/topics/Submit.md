PHASE I
: At this time, you cannot submit your selection. The submission page will display a countdown timer reminding you how much time is left until you can submit.

PHASE II
: At this time, you need to submit your selection as fast as possible because the allocation of Topics is determined by the order of submission.

PHASE III
: Unfortunately, you have missed all the opportunities to submit. Please contact the system manager.
